    // Discussion Points:
    // - for deadlines/expiration, to we work with block.timestamp (current approach) or with block.number?
    // - should we only limit this to swaps or also allow some more advanced stuff (e.g. stake tokens somewhere)?
    // - should we add an additional emergency withdraw function (I would say no since it's a backdoor but it might be better to)
    // - can every DEX directly pay out to specified address or do we need logic that forwards swapped funds to user afterwards?
    // - should we prepare this for multi-hops on dst (more complexity)?
    //   >> I would say in V2 but not for now
    // - is it better to split up the parameters in the events (e.g. to have receiver address indexed)?
    // - do we need to consider any gas limitations (e.g. add the option to provide gas limits, etc.)?
    // - should we bundle all intents in one contract (vs. have them split up between Receiver / RelayerCelerIM / potential future custom receivers)?
    //   >> I would say we keep them in each contract where they belong to
    // - the maxFee still needs to be added - but do we really need that?? I feel it adds unnecessary complexity. We are also the ones that suggest its value on srcChain
    //   so it doesnt really protect the user any more. I think they should just trust us here (also they can see if we charge (much) more than the actual gas cost and can complain)
